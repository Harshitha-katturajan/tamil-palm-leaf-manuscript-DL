### Recovering Lost Tamil Scripts: Advanced Deep Learning Approach for Palm-Leaf Manuscript Character Recognition

This project presents a deep learning solution for recognizing Tamil characters from ancient palm-leaf manuscripts.The proposed approach combines manuscript character extraction with a ResNet-50-based classification framework.

Key features include:
* A hybrid deep learning model trained on the HPL-Tamil and Mendeley Tamil Palm Leaf datasets.
* The model achieved a 96% accuracy on the HPL-Tamil dataset and 92.38% accuracy on characters extracted from manuscripts.
* Preprocessing techniques such as CLAHE, adaptive thresholding, and the Watershed algorithm were used to refine character segmentation.
* The system aims to help preserve Tamil manuscripts and make historical texts more accessible through digitization and character recognition.

This research highlights the potential of deep learning for linguistic preservation and computational epigraphy.
